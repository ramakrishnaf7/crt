Longest Consecutive Sequence


Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109



Code:

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        c = 0
        mc = 0
        nums = set(nums)
        for i in nums:
            if i - 1 not in nums:
                c = 1
                x = i + 1
                while x in nums:
                    c += 1
                    x += 1
            mc = max(c,mc)
        return mc
